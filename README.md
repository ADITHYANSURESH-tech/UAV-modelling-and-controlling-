# UAV-modelling-and-controlling-
This project focuses on modeling, control, and perception of a quadcopter using the Parrot Mambo minidrone in MATLAB/Simulink. PID and LQR controllers ensure stable flight, while Stateflow and image processing enable autonomous maneuvers, visualization, and deployment-ready simulation.
